### Image Compression using Discrete Cosine Transform ###
Image compression is the application of data compression on digital images. Image compression can be lossy or lossless. In this project it is being attempted to implement basic JPEG compression using only MATLAB functions. In this paper the lossy compression techniques have been used, where data loss cannot affect the image clarity in this area. Image compression addresses the problem of reducing the amount of data required to represent a digital image. It is also used for reducing the redundancy that is nothing but avoiding the duplicate data. It also reduces the storage area to load an image. For this purpose we are using JPEG. JPEG is a still frame compression standard, which is based on, the Discrete Cosine Transform and it is also adequate for most compression applications. 

The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a technique for converting a signal into elementary frequency components. It transforms digital image data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. It is widely used in image compression.
